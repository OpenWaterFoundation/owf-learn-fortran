# Version Control #

Version control for Fortran programs is very important for the following reasons:

* Tracks changes to code so that evolution in design can be reviewed and bugs due to new code changes can be identified.
* Allows reverting to older version if necessary.
* Allows contributions from multiple developers to be merged with care, using cloud-hosted repository tools.
* Allows a "master branch" to be maintained as the working code, and tagged with release version numbers.
* Allows bug fixes to be implemented on a "bug fix branch" that is tested before merging into the master branch.
* Allows new enhancements to be developed on a "feature branch" that is tested before merging into the master branch.
* By using Git, which is a distributed version control system, provides redundancy for the entire repository.

This documentation focuses on the Git version control software.

## Installation of Git Software ##

This documentation does not describe how to install and use Git software.
See the [OWF Learn Git documentation](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org#owf-learn-git) for more information.

## Using Git in Development Environment ##

Additional information will be provided here about using various tools for Fortran development, including Eclipse/Photran.
