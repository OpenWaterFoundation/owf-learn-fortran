# Creating Fortran Documentation

Fortran code can be documented with [in-code comments](../fortran/doc/),
which can help software developers that are trying to understand the code.
Also useful is formatted documentation, such as navigable application programming interface (API) HTML,
which provides access to organize documentation for all code modules.
API documentation is particularly useful for libraries where source code may not be directly accessible.

The following sections describe how to use the [Doxygen software](http://www.doxygen.org) to process Fortran code comments into formatted HTML API documentation
and module call graphs.  The Doxygen software should have been installed according to [environment setup instructions](../dev-env/doxygen/).

## Guidelines for Code Comments

Need to include some general guidelines here, including use of TODO, FIXME comments.

## Formatting Code Comments for Doxygen

Doxygen documentation provices guidance on formatting Fortran comments:

* [Comment blocks in Fortran](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html#fortranblocks)

Need to insert some relevant examples here with Doxygen output

## Configuring Doxygen

Need to describe here the Doxygien configuration settings.

## Running Doxygen

Need to describe here how to run Doxygen, view Doxygen output, manage under revision control, and deploy.
