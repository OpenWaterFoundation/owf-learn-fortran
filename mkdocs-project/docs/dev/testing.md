# Testing

Testing Fortran programs is important to ensure that the software functions as intended.
The following sections describe how to test Fortran programs at various levels.

# Unit Testing for Code Modules

Need to evaluate unit testing options for Fortran code.

# Functional Testing for Operational Features

Need to evaluate funcational testing options for Fortran programs.

# Systems Testing for Integrated Software

Systems testing refers to testing a Fortran program with other programs that comprise a system.
For example, testing may include:

* testing hand-off between programs via command-line, files, or other methods
* running multiple processes at the same time
* interactions with databases or web components

Additional information will be included here in the future.

# Performance Testing

At a minimum, performance testing involves timing program execution.
More in-depth performance testing may involve evaluating time spent loading software, reading data, writing output, performing computations, etc.

Need to describe whether Eclipse/Photran has performance evaluation features.

See also [logging](fortran/logging/), which is helpful for writing messages when evaluating performance.
