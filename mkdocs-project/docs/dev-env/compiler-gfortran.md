# Fortran Compiler / GNU (gfortran)

Need to describe how to install and test the GNU Fortran compiler, on Windows, Cygwin, and Linux.

See [gfortran - the GNU Fortran compiler, part of GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).

This is an open source product that should work on the indicated operating systems, but with some hoops dependig on OS.
